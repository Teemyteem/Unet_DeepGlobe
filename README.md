# Reproducibility Study of U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation  

### Description
- The U-Net model, originally designed for biomedical image segmentation, has shown remarkable performance in various image segmentation tasks.  
- This study tests the generalizability of the U-Net model by applying it to a different domain: land cover classification using the DeepGlobe Land Cover dataset.
